--------------------------------
kindly note that
 Link the database to the map processing - where the uploaded files can be seen on the interface by the checker i.e no need to download
- Database used should support spatial data- have been adviced to use folders than Qgis database 
- Automate connection to database - same as the first one i.e database should be linked to interface. what a surveyor uploads should be seen directly on the checkers and DOS interface

- Need to do user classification - apps i.e Surveyor , Director of Survey(DOS), checkers. Registry , Finance ETC
- Feedback for the licensed surveyors - the status bar to show how far his job is gone and a mail response
- Full automation not implemented - no need to download the uploaded plan but comes automatically to the checkers interface

- Prepare demo for next presentation - need to demonstrate  


- Need to understand the enter process of cadastral data processing at SOK  - my part
- Reformat the objectives  - my part
- Donâ€™t generalize the process - you help on the methodology while organizing slides 
- Find major transitions then model on that basis- my part, which being implemented
